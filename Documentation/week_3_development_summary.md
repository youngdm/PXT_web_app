# PXT Web App - Week 3 Development Summary

**Development Period**: Week 3 (October 2024)  
**Goal**: Complete end-to-end validation and export functionality  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## Overview

Week 3 focused on implementing the final components of the PXT Web App demonstration version, completing the full workflow from CSV upload to PXT-tagged export. This week delivered validation functionality and CSV export capabilities, creating a complete working demonstration suitable for workshop presentation.

## Development Accomplishments

### 1. **Validation System Implementation** ✅

**Objective**: Implement Required field validation logic and user feedback

**What Was Built**:
- Complete validation engine in `pxt_tags.py`
- `validate_column_mappings()` function that checks Required PXT fields
- Visual validation status display in web interface
- Color-coded status indicators (red/amber/green)
- Missing field identification and reporting

**Key Features**:
- Validates all Required PXT tags are mapped to columns
- Identifies which Required fields are missing
- Provides clear user feedback on validation status
- Prevents export if critical fields are unmapped

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
def validate_column_mappings(column_mappings):
    """
    Validate column mappings against PXT requirements.
    Returns validation results with missing required fields.
    """
```

### 2. **CSV Export with PXT Tags** ✅

**Objective**: Build CSV export with embedded PXT tags and complete workflow

**What Was Built**:
- Complete export functionality in Flask route `/export`
- PXT tag headers embedded in exported CSV files
- Preservation of all original data while adding standardization
- Automatic file naming convention (`filename_PXT_tagged.csv`)
- Download functionality with proper MIME types

**Key Features**:
- Exports CSV with PXT tags as first data row
- Maintains original column order and data integrity
- Handles untagged columns gracefully (empty PXT tag)
- Provides immediate download to user
- Clean temporary file handling

**Technical Implementation**:
- Uses pandas DataFrame manipulation to insert PXT tags
- Preserves original data structure completely
- Implements secure temporary file creation and cleanup

### 3. **Enhanced Validation Interface** ✅

**Objective**: Complete upload-to-download workflow with user feedback

**What Was Built**:
- `/validate` route displaying validation results and export options
- Enhanced mapping display with tag priority information
- Visual indicators for Required vs Desirable vs Optional fields
- Export readiness status and user guidance

**Key Features**:
- Shows complete mapping summary before export
- Displays validation results prominently
- Provides export button when validation passes
- Clear user guidance for resolving validation issues

### 4. **Complete End-to-End Workflow** ✅

**Objective**: Test complete upload-to-download workflow with multiple datasets

**Workflow Implemented**:
1. **Upload**: CSV file validation and processing
2. **Preview**: Data structure display and column identification
3. **Tagging**: Interactive PXT tag mapping with auto-suggestions
4. **Validation**: Required field checking and status display
5. **Export**: CSV download with embedded PXT tags

**Testing Completed**:
- Tested with peatland research datasets
- Validated complete workflow functionality
- Confirmed PXT tag embedding works correctly
- Verified download and file naming conventions
