# PXT Web App - Peatland eXchange Tags

A web application for applying standardized metadata tags to peatland research data, inspired by HXL Proxy and designed specifically for the peatland research community.

## 🌱 Project Overview

The Peatland eXchange Tags (PXT) Web App helps researchers standardize their peatland datasets using a comprehensive three-level metadata hierarchy:

- **Site Level**: Location and site characteristics (`#pxt_site_*` tags)
- **Event Level**: Observation and measurement details (`#pxt_event_*` tags)  
- **Dataset Level**: Overall collection information (`#pxt_dataset_*` tags)

### Key Features
- ✅ **Privacy-First**: No permanent data storage - all processing is ephemeral
- ✅ **Research-Focused**: Designed for peatland researchers and practitioners
- ✅ **Standards-Based**: Implements 67 standardized PXT tags across three hierarchical levels
- ✅ **Simple Workflow**: Upload → Tag → Download → Store wherever you choose

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic familiarity with command line/terminal

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this project**
   ```bash
   cd PXT_web_app
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   cd app
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your web browser**
   - Go to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
   - You should see the PXT Web App upload page

### Test the Demo
1. Upload the sample file: `data/sample_peatland_data.csv`
2. Review the data preview and column structure
3. Note how this will connect to PXT tagging in future development phases

## 🛠 Current Status: Week 1 Complete

### ✅ What's Working Now (Workshop Demo v0.1)
- File upload interface with drag-and-drop styling
- CSV parsing and validation 
- Data preview with basic statistics
- Column structure analysis
- Professional presentation-ready interface
- Basic error handling and user feedback

### 🚧 In Development (Weeks 2-4)
- **Week 2**: PXT tag application interface with dropdown menus
- **Week 3**: Validation system and CSV export with embedded tags
- **Week 4**: Polish and workshop presentation materials

### 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Multiple file format support (Excel, JSON)
- Advanced validation rules and data quality checking
- Cloud storage integrations
- Collaborative tagging features
- API integrations with research repositories

## 🎯 Workshop Demonstration

This version is being developed for a workshop presentation in approximately one month. The goal is to demonstrate the core PXT tagging concept with a working prototype.

### Demo Workflow
1. **Researcher uploads CSV** → Web interface accepts file
2. **Data preview** → System shows columns and sample data  
3. **PXT tagging** → [Week 2] User maps columns to PXT tags
4. **Validation** → [Week 3] System checks required fields
5. **Export** → [Week 3] User downloads standardized data
6. **Clean up** → All data automatically removed from system

## 🤝 Collaboration

This project is designed for collaborative development:

- **Clear documentation**: Every component explained for new contributors
- **Modular structure**: Easy to work on different parts simultaneously  
- **Version control friendly**: Organized file structure for team development
- **Research community focus**: Built by and for peatland researchers

### Getting Involved
1. Review the `Documentation/project_overview.md` for complete vision
2. Check `Documentation/workshop_demo_plan.md` for development timeline
3. Test the current demo with your own peatland datasets
4. Provide feedback on user experience and missing features

## 📊 PXT Tag Standard

The app implements the PXT Tag Standard v0.1.2, which defines 67 standardized tags:

### Site Level (Required Fields)
- `#pxt_site_id`: Unique site identifier
- `#pxt_site_lat`: Latitude in decimal degrees  
- `#pxt_site_lon`: Longitude in decimal degrees
- `#pxt_site_datum`: Geodetic datum (e.g., WGS84)
- `#pxt_site_type`: Peatland type (bog/fen)
- `#pxt_site_subtype`: Detailed peatland classification

### Event Level (Required Fields)  
- `#pxt_event_id`: Unique event identifier
- `#pxt_event_site_id`: Links to site ID
- `#pxt_event_date`: Event date (ISO format)
- `#pxt_recorded_by`: Observer name

### Dataset Level (Required Fields)
- `#pxt_dataset_id`: Unique dataset identifier
- `#pxt_dataset_title`: Descriptive title
- `#pxt_dataset_description`: Detailed description
- `#pxt_dataset_keywords`: Search keywords
- `#pxt_dataset_contact_name`: Primary contact
- `#pxt_dataset_temporal`: Time coverage

*Full specification available in project documentation*

## 🛡 Privacy & Data Handling

- **No permanent storage**: All data processing is temporary and session-based
- **Automatic cleanup**: Data is cleared from system after processing
- **Local processing**: No data sent to external services
- **Research data governance compliant**: Designed for institutional policies

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" errors**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Port already in use**
```bash
# Try a different port
python app.py  # Then visit http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

**File upload fails**
- Check file size (max 16MB for demo)
- Ensure file has .csv extension
- Verify CSV has headers in first row

### Getting Help
1. Check the error message in your browser
2. Look at the terminal/console output where you ran `python app.py`
3. Review sample data format in `data/sample_peatland_data.csv`
4. Ensure all requirements are installed correctly

## 📈 Development Timeline

- **Week 1** ✅: Basic file upload and preview (Current)
- **Week 2**: PXT tag application interface
- **Week 3**: Validation and export functionality  
- **Week 4**: Workshop preparation and polish

**Target**: Working demonstration for peatland research community workshop

## 🌍 Vision

Enable seamless data exchange across the peatland research community through standardized metadata tagging, supporting FAIR data principles while respecting researcher data sovereignty.
